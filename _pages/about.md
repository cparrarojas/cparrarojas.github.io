<!---I'm a post-doctoral fellow in the [Systems Medicine of Infectious Diseases](http://systemsmedicine.de/) group at the [Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS)](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/).

At the moment, I'm transitioning from academia to industry, with a particular interest in positions in data science/machine learning. During my postdoc, I graduated from Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree and, since then, I've become a Kaggle competitions master. I'm currently working as a data scientist within the 2019 edition of [Science to Data Science (S2DS)](http://s2ds.org), using CRM data to extract actionable insights in order to increase customer retention and aid business growth.


I'm also a wannabe musician, and I'm currently looking for a keyboardist to finish and record an album. The closest influences I can think of are Michał Łapaj from Riverside, Diego Tejeida from Haken and Joakim Svalberg from Opeth. Below, you can listen to a short instrumental teaser. I'm on guitar and have already found actual human beings to record the bass and drums. If you happen to fit the profile, or know someone who does, please get in touch!
